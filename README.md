This board will let you do multi-toolhead setups and can allow you to put more powerful stepper drivers to work on motor upgrades you might want to do, or let you route more power to your extruder for a more powerful hotend. It requires a full front plate and bottom plate swap out, though we did our best to make sure the aesthetics on these guys matched the original profile well enough. It also requires a pair of 5015 fans for the fan upgrade. Make sure to check the wire polarities on the fans vs the Octopus. In our test, they had to be reversed.

RECOMMENDED PRINT MATERIALS:

High temp-resistant filaments such as PETG, PET, ABS, etc. We're not your parents. We can't stop you from printing in PLA and melting your front plate and/or bottom plate and/or mounts to the board. Someone in the comments may say it "worked for them well enough." We'd add "for now," to that comment and remind you that the Octopus is an expensive board to replace.

BILL OF MATERIALS: 

SAVE THE STOCK SCREWS! Amounts listed are considered IN ADDITION TO stock screws.

The bottom and front panel is screwed on via the stock screws, therefore they won't be included in the BOM table

Temp Resistant filament (NOT PLA FOR THE LOVE OF THE GODS)

Adhesives (recommend superglue for the magnets and flexible epoxy for the bottom plate parts, though superglue can work for the latter if it's all you have)

This is the minimum amount, please get more

We expect that before you begin, you will have already installed the motor and hotend upgrades you had wanted to in order to justify the additional power regulation and better stepper drivers on the board. As such, we're not including tutorials on replacing the motors and/or hotend. There are plenty of online guides.
