So, you have a Neptune 3 Plus? You're a tinkerer who just can't stand how slow the ol' reliable has become and wants to take it to the next level? Enter this ridiculous upgrade. 

This board will let you do multi-toolhead setups and can allow you to put more powerful stepper drivers to work on motor upgrades you might want to do, or let you route more power to your extruder for a more powerful hotend. It requires a full front plate and bottom plate swap out, though we did our best to make sure the aesthetics on these guys matched the original profile well enough. It also requires a pair of 5015 fans for the fan upgrade. Make sure to check the wire polarities on the fans vs the Octopus. In our test, they had to be reversed.

RECOMMENDED PRINT MATERIALS:

High temp-resistant filaments such as PETG, PET, ABS, etc. We're not your parents. We can't stop you from printing in PLA and melting your front plate and/or bottom plate and/or mounts to the board. Someone in the comments may say it "worked for them well enough." We'd add "for now," to that comment and remind you that the Octopus is an expensive board to replace.
